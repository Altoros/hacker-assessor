# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Ignore RVM project config files.
# If you currently don't have it and want to create it for yourself,
# install RVM and issue the following command from the project's root directory:
# ```rvm --ruby-version use 2.2.1@ha```
/.ruby-gemset
/.ruby-version
