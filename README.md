# The ultimate Hacker Assessor
Let's try to make a hacker (initialy thought for software developers) career plan much more transparent and easy to grow.

#### As a hacker, 
you'll have the I advantage to know exactly what would it take for you to move to the next level/seniority/position. 
In order to do that I might have to adquire a new skill or improve an existent one. It will also be great to have pointers 
such as lectures, tutors, trainings, videos and books references, etc.

#### As an organization, 
it will be much easier to focus on every hacker's growth and to invest the organization's time 
and money on real and concrete resources you need in order to grow as an organization 
by growing on an individual hacker level basis.
